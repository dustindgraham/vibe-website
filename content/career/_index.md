        ## Customer first
        Everything we do, we do it with the customer in mind. If it doesn’t make the customer happy,
        it doesn’t happen—end of story.

        ## Integrity
        To us, integrity is a combination of truth, transparency, bravery, and common sense.
        We will always fight for what we believe in.

        ## Flexible working arrangement
        We all understand that working at office is not always the most efficient and creative.
        Working from home, coffee bar, or wework workspace, all could be our offices.
    - body: |
        ## Development
        Vibe attaches importance to the personal development. We would assign a mentor for each new employee,
        and encourage all different kinds of learning and knowledge sharing.
    - body: |
        ## Flat organization
        We adopt a flat hierarchical structure, which improves the efficiency of organizations by
        removing management structures, and leaving more freedom for each employee.
    - body: |
        ## Happier weekdays
        A meeting-light culture guest speakers, and opportunities to get to know your team better through
        things like monthly team building, Friday Socials, and game nights.
