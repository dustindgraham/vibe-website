## Whiteboard
### How can my remote students see their teachers drawing on a whiteboard?

There are a few options to share Vibe remotely:

- From the Vibe board, join or host your video conference application (ex: Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet) and
then share your screen so students can see any content shared on the Vibe board.
  - Check [this online teaching video from Vibe customer, Professor Henry Silverman][1].
- Share a link (edit or view only) of the whiteboard with your students so they can interact with you on the canvas
  in real time or view content in real time (note: with this option, they will not be able to see any content shared
  from screencast or 3rd party apps - only what is in the Vibe board app)
- You can also export the Vibe board as a PDF after a lesson and share the file with students after the class.

### Can students interact with the whiteboard in real-time? Even without a Vibe board?

Yes. Vibe is a cloud-based software that is accessible on any web browser or tablet, and Vibe also has an app for
iPad (the mobile app is view-only).

If you want to [share a board][2], simply share the link of the Vibe board you are using as a link (or copy into the
chat during your video conference) so they can interact with you on the canvas in real time.

Note: [Vibe can also be added as an application with Microsoft Teams][3].

### How can I record the screen of the whiteboard?
There are a few options to do screen recordings on Vibe:

- Record your screen using a 3rd party application, such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet.
- Use a 3rd party app called 'XRecorder' to record the screen.
- Use the HDMI out port with a capture card or cable to another device. 

### Can you open a web browser on the side of the whiteboard and import pictures from a website?
Yes. You can open a web browser app (like Chrome or Opera) and screenshot the pictures you want, then select which
board to save your images to.

You can also do this in a split-screen mode, to make it easier to see which pictures you have already imported. 

### Can you import images, PowerPoint, and PDF files into the whiteboard?
Yes. Vibe supports all of these formats, depending on which cloud storage option you are using.

### How is the learning curve of this tool? Do you offer training?
Using Vibe is similar to using a giant tablet or iPad. It is easy to learn and fun to use! Vibe doesn't require
extra computers, projectors, or calibration. Setting up Vibe is similar to installing a new TV. 

You can find video tutorials on our website, and we provide complimentary onboarding training sessions.
