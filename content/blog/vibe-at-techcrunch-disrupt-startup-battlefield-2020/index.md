Today was a big day for Vibe. Out of thousands of Startups, [Vibe was chosen for a slot at Startup Battlefield](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/announcing-the-startup-battlefield-companies-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2020/?tpcc=ECTW2020), an event that TechCrunch has held as part of its Disrupt event for the last ten years.

Most of the companies had months to prepare. We were a Wildcard team, which means that we had less than a week.

With our CEO, Charles Yang, presenting from Hangzhou, China, and Katie Kalafus, Head of Sales, doing the demo from Seattle, Washington--and a 15 hour time difference--this was no easy task. Fortunately, we all have Vibe boards to help us [build the presentation](https://app.vibe.us/smart.ALL_BOARDS/0crrEmeGiilc9FALlZG2US/NFgbXOvmmUkQDKmzJmFTPy) and sync over video conference.

Check out long-form answers to the Q&A session below.

**Startup Battlefield Judge, Amish Jani, FirstMark Capital - Seems like a crowded landscape with Miro and Mural; are you targeting a different segment or a specific vertical?**

The products are simply different. Miro/Mural focus on PC online whiteboarding services, so they’re built with a keyboard and mouse in mind. Vibe’s entire user interface is built around using a touchscreen and stylus. Handwriting and drawing have long been favored for brainstorming and collaboration sessions because they unlock deeper thinking.

The buyer journey is also different. With the hardware, we are targeting different industries, scenarios, and experiences. With Vibe, you can do way more than just whiteboarding. We have more potential for new services.

**Startup Battlefield Judge, Monique Woodard, Cake Ventures - You have hardware/whiteboard, you have software - have you thought about creating community?** 

We haven’t started an official community, but our customers are already sharing content that they’ve created with Vibe. In particular, we see high-level consultants in sales, marketing, and finance using Vibe to present to their prospective clients via YouTube or other platforms. Teachers are also creating shared libraries of materials to use across their classrooms.

**Startup Battlefield Judge, Jessica Verrilli, GV - Does anyone use the product in single-player mode or is it collaborative?**

Vibe was designed for local and remote collaboration, but many of our customers use Vibe by themselves to brainstorm and sketch out ideas, just like they would on a standard whiteboard. Vibe layers on benefits like an infinite canvas, multiple boards, cloud-based service to access boards from anywhere, and being able to pull in any files you like for annotation. 
Customers also screencast to Vibe for a second monitor and can even use 3rd party like Netflix or YouTube for entertainment.

**Startup Battlefield Judge, Erik Moore, Base Ventures: How do you go up against more established competitors? Is it a marketing problem?**

It's a crowded space but it is still an unsolved problem. No one has solved the problem yet, so that's why we had to build Vibe.

It is fundamentally a product problem. The big players are so far from customer and their core business that they do not have the efficiency/determination/vantage point to solve this problem for their customers. Selling through channels loses the connection with customers. That can work for hardware, but for SaaS businesses, it’s a losing proposition. Vibe’s direct connection to our end-users means that we’re constantly learning from their asks and behaviors to make our products even better.

The marketing environment and user needs have changed and established competitors are building out from the same channel marketing strategies that they’ve held for 30-40 years. Vibe’s direct to consumer model revolves around our customers, and our digital marketing showcases the opportunities presented by Vibe’s open app ecosystem. We want customers to use our platform in the way that’s best for them, and not lock them into limited choices.
