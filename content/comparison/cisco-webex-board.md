    The Cisco Webex Board is a digital whiteboard launched by Cisco to meet the collaboration needs of businesses.
    Originally called the Spark Board, the Webex is currently available in 55”, 70”, and 85” screens.

    ## Key Takeaway
    The Cisco Webex Board offers comprehensive video conferencing capabilities at a correspondingly high price point.
    This board is locked into the Cisco Webex ecosystem and does not integrate with other video conferencing software.

    ## Cisco Webex Pricing
    The 55” model starts at $4,990, with an additional $199 per month for cloud service. Stands range from $1,590
    (wall) to $3,290 (floor) and mounts are $449.

    ## Cisco Webex Highlights
    With the Webex Board, users can wirelessly connect to other Cisco devices using the Webex Teams app. Team members
    can join a meeting by screen sharing the whiteboard, which allows remote workers to annotate on the same canvas as
    their colleagues in a different location. Anyone using a device registered in the Cisco Webex cloud can save their
    work and access it later for convenience and efficiency.

    The board’s 4K camera responds to movement in the room, making it easy to open a video conference. The multi-point
    microphone system responds to voice commands and is able to focus on and amplify the speaker’s voice in a team
    meeting with up to 10 people in one room.

    The board’s advanced video conferencing features and easy-to-use collaborative tools make the Cisco Webex a good
    choice for educational purposes. Universities use the Webex to facilitate both in-classroom and online learning.

    ## What’s Missing
    Offices that don’t run predominantly on Webex Teams will find this subscription requirement to be a challenge.
    Connecting non-Webex users—for example, anyone using Zoom, GoToMeeting, or other popular online video conferencing
    tools—would be a problem. This would primarily be a concern for businesses with a large contingency of remote or
    freelance workers.

    To get the most out of your Cisco Webex board, your office must purchase monthly or yearly Webex subscriptions.
    Without this, the board can only be used for in-room presentations. It’s also worth noting that although a floor
    stand is available for the board, the stand itself isn’t mobile, largely confining the board to one location.

    Another less obvious drawback is the amount of Webex hardware and software combinations that exist. Sorting
    through the various pieces of tech, subscription plans, and software programs is a confusing process, and it’s
    hard to know if you’re paying for equipment and programs you’ll actually use or if you’ll be overpaying for
    underutilized items.

  title: How It Compares to Vibe
  body: |
    The Vibe board opens up your meeting options. Compatible with any USB webcam, Vibe allows teams to video
    conference with third-party apps and share the whiteboard screen in real-time. This gives remote teams the
    option to use Webex Meetings, GoToMeeting, Google Hangouts, or a selection of other video conferencing
    tools—whichever works best for the team.

    The Vibe board also features a portable, wheeled stand so you can easily move the meeting location and keep
    your equipment with you. And once you leave the meeting room, it’s easy to switch to your mobile device and
    pick up where you left off by using the Vibe app.

    With a suite of built-in integrations that includes Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Slack, Microsoft Teams,
    Asana, and more, users will find that Vibe slots in nicely with existing workflows. Need to present to clients?
    You can easily drag the PowerPoint from OneDrive and screencast it from your laptop or using an HDMI connection.
    Then remove the PowerPoint and write down your client’s feedback on Vibe’s infinite canvas.

    At $2,999.00, Vibe costs significantly less than the Cisco Webex board. There is no subscription fee and the
    pricing and options are straightforward.
