    As one of the first products made for the digital whiteboard space, Microsoft’s Surface Hub made its debut
    in 2015. With the 2019 release of the Surface Hub 2S, this interactive whiteboard continues to establish its
    presence in the business world.

    ## Key Takeaway
    Finding the right product comes down to balancing features and capabilities with budget. Priced at $2,999
    (vs. the $8,999 price tag of the Surface Hub) Vibe offers a cost effective solution for small- to mid- sized
    marketing and design agencies, startups, and tech firms.

    The Surface Hub is a good choice if you only need to use Microsoft applications and are interested in a device
    that has a battery pack option.

    ## Microsoft Surface Hub 2S Pricing
    The Surface Hub S2 is just under $9,000 for the 50” model. The wall mount costs $249, the mobile stand costs
    $1,450, and the battery expansion will run you an additional $1,400.

    ## Microsoft Surface Hub 2S Highlights
    Like most digital whiteboards, the Surface Hub 2S features built-in technology for video conferences and
    whiteboarding sessions. The responsive touchscreen is designed to feel as natural as drawing on a traditional
    whiteboard.

    The Surface Hub 2S’s 4K digital display enables real-time creation so you can work alongside your colleagues
    on projects. Screen sharing allows your team to access the canvas and share Office 365 files.

    While the original Surface Hub was optimized for meetings, the new edition goes a step further in upping its
    video conferencing game by including a modular 4K camera. Users can select from a few different plug-in
    locations to find their ideal camera angle.

    Another notable feature of the S2 is the battery expansion. The battery holds a two-hour charge 
    and takes 90 minutes to fully charge. This, combined with the board’s slimmed down design (weighing 40 percent
    less than the previous model), gives users the option to make meetings mobile.

    ## What’s Missing
    Like its predecessor, the Surface Hub S2 is heavily reliant on the Universal Windows 10 application system,
    which creates an issue for companies who don’t run primarily on Microsoft software.

    For instance, connecting to a video conference via Skype requires an Exchange Server or an Office 365 for
    Business account along with Skype for Business. In this situation, calling non-Skype users isn’t easy, and
    is just one example to consider when hiring freelancers, contract workers, or creating future remote work
    opportunities.

    The S2 runs on the software of the previous Surface Hub, so the sleeker hardware is the most notable change
    with the update. Microsoft’s goal is for companies to be able to switch out the central processing unit with
    future updates, but without knowing how long it’ll be before that’s possible, purchasing the S2 is a big
    investment.

    Another major (and expensive) drawback: all of the useful accessories cost extra. So on top of paying around
    $9,000 for the board, the wall mount costs $249, the mobile stand costs $1,450, and the battery expansion
    will run you an additional $1,400.

  title: How It Compares to Vibe
  body: |
    There are more than 40 third-party app integrations in the Vibe board, and that includes Microsoft Teams,
    One Drive, and the most popular Office components. Combine the vast integration opportunities with wireless
    screencasting and you can bring more creativity to your presentations without limiting which apps you can use.

    With Vibe, sharing ideas with collaborators — in-house, across town, or around the world — is intuitive and
    easy, making it a must-have device for any company that thrives thanks to a network of remote workers.

    One less obvious advantage Vibe has over its competitors is its dedication to customers of all sizes. They
    offer free customer support and consistently make changes to the VibeOS based on user requests, making it
    the perfect match for everyday presenters, designers, project managers, and remote workers.
