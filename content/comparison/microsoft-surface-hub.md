  title: What’s the difference between Surface Hub and Vibe?
  body: |
    The Vibe Board and Surface Hub both offer built-in technology for meetings and whiteboarding sessions.
    Both solutions provide a large digital display enabling real-time creation on the same canvas and screen
    sharing with your colleges.

    Surface Hub is optimized for video conferencing. However, it is heavily reliant on the Universal Windows 10
    application ecosystem. Offices that don’t run predominantly on Microsoft software will find connectivity to
    be a challenge. For example, connecting via Skype requires an Exchange Server or an Office 365 for Business
    account along with Skype for Business. Calling non-Skype users — e.g. most of your freelancers and remote
    employees — isn’t easy.

    Vibe is developed on a more open android ecosystem. Wireless screencast and powerful annotation features
    (annotation includes PDF, Image, Screen, HDMI, etc ) bring more creativity to your presentation. There are
    more than 40 app third party integrations in the vibe smart board, such as Google Drive, One Drive, Slack,
    Asana and etc.

    Here we provide a feature comparison between Vibe and Surface Hub.

why:
  title: Why Vibe?
  body: |
    Vibe offers a more cost effective solution for small- to mid- sized marketing and design agencies, startups,
    and tech firms. While Surface hub costs nearly $9, 000 per unit, vibe only costs $2,999. Finding the right
    product comes down to balancing features and capabilities with budget.

    The Vibe smart board integrates an infinite canvas for whiteboarding, wireless screencast and more than 40
    third app integrations into one collaboration hub. With Vibe, sharing ideas with collaborators — in-house,
    across town, or around the globe — has never been easier. Vibe is the perfect addition to any collaborative
    workspace. For companies that thrive thanks to a network of remote collaborators, it’s a must-have device.

    One less obvious advantage Vibe has over its competitors is it’s small production and development team. Vibe
    offers white-glove customer support, and their team consistently makes changes to VibeOS based on user requests.

    Vibe is the perfect match for everyday presenters, designers, project managers and remote workers.
