    The Jamboard is a 55” cloud-based digital whiteboard designed for businesses and education programs.
    Launched by Google in 2017, the Jamboard was designed as a direct competitor to the Microsoft Surface Hub.

    ## Key Takeaway:
    Google Jamboard is a great fit if your business runs primarily on G Suite. But if you need the flexibility
    to use applications outside of the Google ecosystem (at almost half the price) it’s time to check out Vibe.

    ## Jamboard Pricing:
    Google Jamboard starts at $4,999 and comes standard with a wall mount, with additional charges after purchase.
    Jamboard users pay an annual $600 subscription and support fee, as well as $12/month for access to a GSuite
    Business account. The Jamboard’s mobile stand is $1,349 and is sold separately.

    ## Jamboard Highlights
    The Jamboard has 4K display and a built-in camera and microphone, making it easy to run a Google Hangout video
    conference with your team or customers from the device. 

    Each board comes with 2 styluses, which you can use to draw during whiteboarding sessions. You can also draw
    on the touchscreen with your finger, as well as erase with your hand or use the board’s physical eraser.

    For users who aren’t directly interacting with the Jamboard, whiteboard content can be accessed using Android
    and iOS apps on a range of personal mobile devices. (Depending on how you join the session, though, your ability
    to contribute to the session may be limited.)

    Anyone who starts a session on the Jamboard can invite other users to join as long as those users have a Gmail
    account or are registered with your business’s G Suite account. Team members participating through the smartphone
    app can add files to the session through Google Drive and a selection of Google Images, but they can’t directly
    annotate on the canvas.

    When your session is done or needs to move to a new location, it is saved to the cloud so you can share with
    other users and refer back to the saved session.

    ## What’s Missing
    While using the Jamboard is fairly intuitive, it doesn’t allow all users to access the whiteboarding sessions
    equally. People who access the session through a tablet-based app can contribute to the session by adding files
    and notes from their Drive, but users who don't have the Jamboard app can only participate in view-only mode.

    Many projects require using more than one app, and the Jamboard doesn’t support simultaneous app usage.
    This severely limits versatility for brainstorming sessions with multiple people using the board at the same time.

    Users can get a lot accomplished with G Suite, but it doesn’t include some of today’s most popular business,
    video conferencing, and workflow apps. Jamboard’s limited suite of integrations could mean that your office will
    have to adjust the way projects are completed, which could cost you valuable time.

  title: How It Compares to Vibe
  body: |
    Vibe also has a 55” touchscreen with 4K resolution. Vibe boards come with digital whiteboard software built
    in, and features an infinite canvas so your ideas and brainstorming sessions are never limited.
    With robust writing and drawing options, Vibe comes out with new software features every 2-3 weeks. 

    Some of the tools you can use through the intuitive touchscreen include:

    - Import images and documents from Google Drive, Dropbox or OneDrive
    - Background colors and grid options
    - AI text convertor (converts handwriting into text)
    - highlighter for document annotation
    - laser pointer for presentations
    - 2 split screen options so you can whiteboard next to 40+ 3rd party applications
    - Colorful sticky notes
    - Software apps for computers and tablets to help your team stay connected in real time
    - and more!

    All Vibe users can edit the canvas in real time through the Vibe board, Mac, PC, or tablet devices when you
    share a link to that board. So whether you’re in the office or working remotely, you can collaborate seamlessly
    with your team.

    Vibe users also have access to over 40 third-party app integrations. This includes Google Drive as well as the
    Microsoft Office Suite, Slack, Asana, Zoom, and many more. Your team can use the tools you’ve already invested
    time and money in without having to learn a new system.

    Wirelessly screencast from any device using Airplay, Chromecast, or eShare, or use an HDMI cable. Annotate on
    anything - while screencasting or using 3rd party apps, you can easily annotate and save screenshots to your
    board. 

    Work on your project without interruption, because Vibe lets you run multiple apps at the same time. For example,
    if you want to give a presentation to your teams or clients, you can easily access the PowerPoint from OneDrive
    on your Vibe board or screencast it from your laptop.

    Compatible with most USB webcams, Vibe can be used in tandem with 3rd party video conference apps so you can
    share the whiteboard screen with remote participants and get the most from your meetings and brainstorming
    sessions. 

    At $2,999, Vibe is almost half the price of the Google Jamboard, but with more functionality and collaboration
    with other applications. Vibe is compatible with standard wall mounts and also offers an optional mobile stand
    for only $500. Best of all, Vibe’s software is included in your hardware purchase.  Vibe has detailed Help Center
    resources and offers ongoing customer support by phone and email at no extra charge.
