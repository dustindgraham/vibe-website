    The Samsung Flip 2 is a budget-friendly digital whiteboard that brings more collaboration to standard
    presentations. Designed to replace traditional flipcharts and marker-only whiteboards, the Flip 2 works best for
    small to mid-sized businesses.

    ## Key Takeaway:
    The Samsung Flip 2 is a practical and reliable way to engage same-location teams in creative collaborations.
    But Vibe gives your business more ways to grow, share, and work together for just a little bigger investment,
    and we think that’s worth it.

    ## Samsung Flip 2 Pricing:
    The Flip 2’s 55” model costs $2,199 and is sold separately from the mobile stand ($499).

    ## Samsung Flip 2 Highlights:
    The most distinct feature of the Flip 2—in fact, the feature that gives the board its name— is its ability to
    flip from a horizontal to vertical position, just as you would be able to do with a standard paper flipchart.
    (Though it’s important to note that this is only possible with the 55” model.)

    Also similar to a paper flipchart is the Flip 2’s natural drawing and annotating abilities. Up to four people
    can draw on the board simultaneously, which is ideal for a team brainstorming session. The board was also
    designed with efficiency in mind, so the editing tools are quick and easy to use.

    Users can wirelessly connect to the board and changes will be reflected across all connected devices. With the
    Flip 2, team members can share Microsoft Office files, brainstorming sessions, drawings and more via email,
    screenshare, thumb drive, or printed sheets.

    ## What’s Missing
    The Flip 2 is a good business tool, but the limited access to third-party apps keeps it from being the best
    option for collaboration. Users can view PDFs and open files from Microsoft Office, but  the ability to
    integrate a large variety of apps doesn’t exist.

    Because video conferencing apps like GoToMeeting and Zoom are inaccessible on the Flip 2 (and the board doesn’t
    have a built-in camera), your team’s meeting, training, or brainstorming session is limited to whoever is in the
    same room. Any business with remote workers would need to find another solution for keeping the team on the same
    page.

    On the subject of pages, it’s important to note that work sessions on the Flip 2 are limited to 20 pages. This
    could be plenty of space for some users and smaller projects; however, knowing that other digital whiteboards
    have an infinite canvas makes the 20-page limit seem restrictive.

  title: How It Compares to Vibe
  body: |
    Compatible with any USB webcam, Vibe allows teams to video conference using third-party apps
    (like Zoom, Skype, GoToMeeting, and Webex) and share the whiteboard screen in real time.
    Whether you’re using a mobile phone, laptop, tablet, or Vibe board, you can easily join a meeting with
    your work-from-home colleagues and seamlessly collaborate.

    The Vibe whiteboarding experience includes an infinite canvas with an AI text converter for handwriting,
    highlighter for document annotation, lasso tool for edits, sticky notes, and much more. These writing and
    drawing options let you design, edit, and continue to refine your work.

    And because it’s likely that remote team members are working on a variety of tech products, Vibe supports
    screencasting from computers and mobile devices to the Vibe board regardless of the device’s manufacturer.
