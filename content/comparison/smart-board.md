    ## Key Takeaway:
    SMART Boards have been a popular choice for school districts, but they offer tiered functionality that requires
    multiple subscriptions or licenses. Make sure that you have a full understanding of the functionality that you’re
    getting with the included software.

    ## SMART Board Pricing:
    $4,999 for the 6000 series boards, additional software costs.

    ## SMART Board Highlights:
    SMART boards are available in a range of sizes with varying functionalities. Depending on whether you’re using
    the board in a business or education setting, users can select from the MX, 6000, or 7000 series for boards with
    interactive touchscreen displays.

    Multiple people can work together directly on the board. SMART Technology’s 6000 series board responds to up to
    eight touchpoints and can detect whether the user is drawing with a stylus or erasing by hand. You can connect up
    to eight devices simultaneously for screen sharing. SMART Technology puts a lot of emphasis on the board as an
    educational tool, which makes the free one-year subscription to the SMART Learning Suite software with the
    purchase of a board a nice bonus for educators.

    Business users can make the most of their board’s capabilities with features like Meeting Pro and TeamWorks,
    which provide access to a limited number of apps, such as Microsoft 365 and most video conferencing apps.

    ## What’s Missing
    The SMART Board has many interesting and useful capabilities; however, nearly all of the best features that set
    the SMART Board apart from other digital whiteboards require several subscriptions or licenses.

    For businesses, the SMART TeamWorks software enables groups to meet and collaborate, but there are different
    levels of access.

    - The Rooms edition allows you to work with people in the same room, and you can screen share with up to eight
      devices, but those devices can’t contribute to a shared workspace.
    - The next level up, Connected, lets other devices contribute to the workspace but they all have to be on the
      same network.
    - Users have to add a Server subscription to the Connected edition before they can allow remote workers to
      join in.

    As previously mentioned, classrooms receive a one-year subscription to the SMART Learning Suite service with
    purchase of a board but will have to pay for Learning Suite access after that year. The basic plan still has
    nice features, but without the Learning Suite the board’s functionality (primarily the collaboration tools)
    feels incomplete.

    Another missed opportunity for the SMART Board is the ability to save your work to the cloud. Users need to
    email or save a PDF of their whiteboard content if they plan on sharing it.

  title: How It Compares to Vibe
  body: |
    The Vibe board is designed to easily work with popular educational apps like Blackboard, Canvas,
    and Panapto to encourage creative learning. But users aren’t limited to just a handful of app integrations.
    Vibe gives you access to over 40 third-party apps so you can use whichever programs meet your needs.

    There are no subscriptions, licenses, or confusing mix-and-match software requirements to get what you want.
    Any device with the Vibe app, regardless of location, can access the infinite canvas, files, video conference,
    or whatever you need to access that day.

    Vibe users can also seamlessly collaborate in real time through the Vibe board, Mac, PC, or mobile device.
    Once you leave the physical meeting room, it’s easy to switch to your handy devices and pick up where you left
    off. Vibe also supports screencasting from computers and mobile devices to the board, regardless of the device’s
    manufacturer.

    Another big selling point? The price. At $2,999, Vibe is less than half the price of the SMART Board 6000 series.
